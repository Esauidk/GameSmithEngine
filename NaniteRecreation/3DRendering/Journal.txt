Need to setup a bindable system for different resources (like the system from Chilli). This needs to be renderer-agnostic

Will be working with already made and formatted models (donut model for example)

Idea:
Every render is given a ModelImport function. It will take in the model in question and translate it for its specific framework

DirectX Bindable System:
Make classes for resources that can be binded:
	- Vertex Buffer
	- Index Buffer
	- Vertex Shader
	- Pixel Shader
	- Topology
	- Constant Buffer

We also need a class to represent a translation of a model to hold all the bindables
