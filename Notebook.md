Looking into a math library. Still contemplating whether I create my own math library or use DirectXMath.
It seems very powerful and well made. Looking into SIMD-friendly math library creation, it's pretty new for me. Compiler intrisics huh?
I'll keep looking into what is generally used today by game studios.
